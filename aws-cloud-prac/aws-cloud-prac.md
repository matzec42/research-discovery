## 5. Intro.

## 6. AWS Account Overview
- Unique email account and credit card; creates a root user
- Best practice -- strong password, avoid using root user (full control) acct --> use AWS IAM (identity & access mgmt) acct to create users, groups, roles, policies (more managed and secure)
- Login thru AWS Management Console, authenticate w/ AWS IAM

## 7. Create Free AWS acct
- Unsure of my acct w/ CS, B. seemed to have set it up and he created a role (?) for me. Existing IAM but not able to login
- Create a new acct. **NOTE:** free acct is good for 6 months, then either transition to paid plan or it gets closed automatically

## 8. Configure Account, Create a Budget Alarm
- Created an alias (see screenshots for IAM acct ID, acct alias, and sign-in URL for this IAM)
- Billing preferences (set alarm) and budget plan ($5 a month) under Bills

## 10. Install Tools and Configure AWS CLI
