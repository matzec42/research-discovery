# 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp (Angela Yu)

## Section 1 --- Notes

### 1. - 3. (intro / set up stuff)



### 4. Day 1 Goals: what we will make by the end of the day

- Band name generator --- basic web app with a button, takes two user inputs and returns a statement (a way to get familiar with **print** function, variables, objects, etc.)



### 5. Download and Setup PyCharm for Learning

- Done. **Note: might have to install SSL certificates at a later date (?). Part of her directions but didn't come up during install
- **PyCharm** is the IDE for Python
    - I imported VS Code settings during my initial set up



### 6. Printing to the Console in Python

- **print** function (a.k.a, Python's console.log)
- Mac shortcut for running code in the IDE: **Cmd + R**
- Me: don't use semi-colons at end of lines like JS. Not a common practice in Python

- **Coding Exercise 1: Printing Practice**
    - In the Udemy course playlist (has a built-in IDE in the webpage for the course)
    - Using **print** function



### 7. String Manipulation and Code Intelligence

- **\n** to create a new line (e.g., `print("Hello World!\nHello world")`)
- use of **+** to concatenate strings is the same as JS
- outside of strings, **spaces** in Python are important -- e.g., a space before print throws a **indentation error** ("unexpected indent")

- **Coding Exercise 2: Debugging Practice**
    - In Udemy -- simple debugging exercise (stray or missing parens, closing "", etc.)



### 8. The Python Input Function

- **input** function is another built in func. 
- W/in a **print** function, we placed **input**
    - Ex: `print("Hello " + input("What is your name?") +"!")`
    - Python executes input function first, code remains running while awaiting for user input in Python Console
    - Upon typing and hitting enter, we print `"Hello Angela!"`, where Angela is the return value of the input function



### 9. Python Variables
